To test out this project, a common-lisp compiler is needed. I
personally use SBCL. It also needs the library imago and py4cl.

You can use them by cloning the projects in ~/quicklisp/local-projects/

git@github.com:tokenrove/imago.git
git@github.com:bendudson/py4cl.git

Note: py4cl is setup in display code to use python3, so you need
it installed. You also need to have a environment with numpy and
matplotlib.

All functions are dispersed in several files, only the main.lisp
is useful to test out the several functions and display the result.
